A very easy to use desktop GUI for TinyPNG where you can compress your images quickly and painlessly using a pleasant interface. Drag as many images as you wish onto the app's window and you're done, is that simple. You can also keep or discard metadata, choose how you wish to overwrite or scale your images and keep track of how many compressions you've done per month.
