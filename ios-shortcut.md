Shortcut updated to iOS18. It compresses (and resizes) images with TinyPNG or TinyJPG on your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Once done it displays savings in file size and shows the compressed file in a Share Sheet, which then can be saved to the device, or shared with a different Shortcut or App. Feel free to modify the Shortcut to save the file wherever you want.
